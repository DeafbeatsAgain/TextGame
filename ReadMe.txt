Running this program will bring you to the Main Menu:
1. New Game
    really the only option.
2. Continue Game
    not yet implemented, pls ignore.
3. Exit
    actually closes the program.

Once you type "1" for a New Game, it'll ask you for your name and welcome you to the game

FIRST STEP PICK A CAR
    STATS ARE VISIBLE, THIS IS NOT INTENTIONAL, BUT IT MAKES TESTING EASIER

SECOND STEP CHOOSE A RACETRACK
    Only 2 options for now, the intent is to have parodies of Daytona Tracks

THIRD STEP ENTER THE NUMBER OF AI PLAYERS (8 max for now)
    I can't tell what is causing this to be limited to 9 but it's actually 9 not 8. I
    eventually want to expand this to 39 AI total for a field of 40 like NASCAR.

FOURTH STEP
    THE RESULTS DISPLAY VIOLENTLY, NOT GIVING YOU ANY TIME TO WONDER IF YOU'RE A TRACKSTAR.

After the results, it dumps you back to the main menu.
When in a more finished state, it will write to a "save file" that can be picked up with
continue.

Thank you for reading.
